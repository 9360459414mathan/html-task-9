  <p>Let’s dive right into paragraph structure. A basic paragraph has five sentences: one topic sentence, three supporting sentences, and one concluding sentence.

The first sentence, or topic sentence, introduces the main idea that will be presented in the paragraph; the supporting sentences dissect and support the main idea, sometimes with statistics or hard evidence; and the concluding sentence answers the question, “So what?”

How Long is a Paragraph?
You’re not off the hook yet. We just discussed the structure of a basic paragraph, which includes 3 types of sentences. However, not all paragraphs will be 5 sentences long, and many paragraphs will utilize a myriad of different sentence types.

Okay, you might be wondering, then how many sentences are in a paragraph? Well, it depends. Technically, a paragraph can be one sentence long, or it can be over seven sentences long.

Some people argue that a paragraph should be measured by its ideas and not its sentence lengths, but a good general rule of thumb is to keep your paragraphs between 3 to 5 sentences long. This ensures that you are brief but still thorough in your writing.
